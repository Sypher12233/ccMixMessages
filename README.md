To run the `app.js` file you need to have [node](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjhprupsuD6AhUG_CoKHY_0AEUQjBB6BAgJEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnodejs.org%2Fen%2Fdownload%2F&usg=AOvVaw3mpn_kqKBfLUVM2X6RrMKX) installed on your machine.

From the terminal (either on vscode or not) run;

```js
node app.js
```
